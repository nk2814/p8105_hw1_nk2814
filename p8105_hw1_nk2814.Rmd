## Problem 1



```{r problem1}

# First, load tidyverse package.
library(tidyverse)   

# Set a seed to ensure reproducibility

set.seed(1)

# Next, define data frame called 'problem1_df'

problem1_df = tibble(    
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),    # a random sample of size 8
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0, # a logical vector 
  vec_char = c("this", "is", "my", "first", "time", "using",   "this", "software"),   # a character vector of length 8
  vec_factor = factor(c("one", "two", "three", "one", "two", "three", "one", "two"))
)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
