## Problem 1



```{r problem1_chunk1}

# First, load tidyverse package.
library(tidyverse)   

# Set a seed to ensure reproducibility

set.seed(1)

# Next, define data frame called 'problem1_df'

problem1_df = tibble(    
  norm_samp = rnorm(8),    # a random sample of size 8
  norm_samp_pos = norm_samp > 0, # a logical vector 
  vec_char = c("this", "is", "my", "first", "time", "using",   "this", "software"),   # a character vector of length 8
  vec_factor = factor(c("one", "two", "three", "one", "two", "three", "one", "two"))
)

# Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesnâ€™t?

mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp)) # mean is calculated. result below.
                                   

mean(pull(problem1_df, norm_samp_pos)) # mean is calculated. result below.
                                       
mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_char)) # unable to calculate the mean of this character vector. error message below.

mean(pull(problem1_df, vec_factor)) # unable to calculate the mean of this factor vector. error message below.
